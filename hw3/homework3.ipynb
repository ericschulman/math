    "The identity matrix also has eigenvector set all of the underlying vector space $V$, but no other matrix except a multiple of the identity matrix has this property. As a result, if a matrix $A$ has $k$ eigenvectors, those are also going to be eigenvectors of $I$. However another vector not in the set of $A$'s eigenvectors would still be an eigenvectors of $I$. Hence, they commute, but have a different set of eigenvectors.\n"
