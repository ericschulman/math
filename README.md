# Overview

Code solving UT Numerical Anaylsis excersizes

# Fall M 387C

The fall focused on numerical optimization, approximation, and linear algebra. It is an introduction to scientific computing, theory and application of numerical linear algebra, solution of nonlinear equations, and numerical approximation of functions.
1. HW1 - Conditioning numbers, norms, floating point numbers
2. HW2 - Givens rotations, Conjugate gradient methods
3. HW3 - Singular value decompositions, Newton iterations
4. HW4 - Numerical optimization
5. HW5 - Splines, numerical integration
6. HW6 - Wavelets, Nueral networks

# Spring M 387D

The spring excersizes focus on ODEs and PDEs. It is an introduction to the theory and practice of commonly used numerical algorithms for the solution of ordinary differential equations, and elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic partial differential equations. Three lecture hours a week for one semester.
